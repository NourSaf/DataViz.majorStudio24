### Cultural Origins
![Sketch02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108e19bf-96ff-408e-b306-9f3cac6fa978)


This visualization analyzes the collection from the Anthropology Department by categorizing objects into tools, textiles, and other types to explore the diversity of the collection. It also aims to address two key questions: where do the collection's objects originate, and from which cultures do they come?

The visualization tool combines a map to pinpoint the geographical origins of the objects and the location of the corresponding cultures. Additionally, a bubble chart is used to represent the quantity of objects within each category (e.g., tools), and pictograms are employed to break down each category, showing the specific objects it contains.

### Entomological Diversity

![Sketch03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f9be10-821b-4e5c-a645-cf0600fdb076)

Data from Entomology Dept. 
The visualization aims to analyze and visualize the diversity of the collection. It categorizes insects based on taxonomy and their functional roles in ecosystems. Each category has a dedicated view to address two key questions: how are the insects in the collection categorized in terms of their ecological roles, and what are the most represented species or orders of insects in the collection? The visualization tools used include a combination of an interactive map and a circular chart.
